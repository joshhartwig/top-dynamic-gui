# The Odin Project Dynamic UI project
The purpose of this project was to use JS,CSS and HTML to create a dynamic menu that 'pops' out when you hover over it. Additonally to create a image slider control. I had taken a few months off top since I worked this project, I was rusty and needed to get back into the swing of things. This could be cleaned up quite a bit.
